# How to contribute

1. Make a branch off of the `main` branch, name it something related to the changes you are making.
2. Commit your edits to your branch.
3. Make sure to test your changes. This is a good opportunity to take screen shots so you can show off the changes.
4. Make a pull request to merge your branch into `main`. You can help this process by sharing screen shots to show off the change as well as including a description of what the change does.
5. Wait for a review.
6. Once the review is done, the changes will get merged in to the `main` branch.
